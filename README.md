Architecture
I used a variety of frontend development technologies in my full stack project, such as HTML for content organization, JavaScript for dynamic interactions, and Express for server-side functionality. Using a single-page application (SPA) to provide a more seamless user experience was a crucial component. Because NoSQL MongoDB databases are scalable and flexible, they are a great fit for the dynamic nature of web applications, which is why I choose one for the backend. This decision also made interaction with the frontend easier, especially because MongoDB's document-based data architecture compliments the widely used JSON format in JavaScript.

Functionality
Though it is separate from JavaScript, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data transfer format that draws inspiration from JavaScript object syntax. JSON functions as a standard data format that both frontend and backend systems can comprehend, and is mostly used to transfer data between a server and a web application. It connects front-end and back-end development by offering a common data format that enables smooth communication between the two levels. I often refactored code during the entire stack development process to increase efficiency and functionality, especially when developing reusable user interface (UI) components.

Testing
The HTTP methods that are utilized in a full stack application to communicate with server endpoints are referred to as methods. GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (delete data) are examples of common methods. Endpoints are unique URLs on the server that are associated with certain resources or activities. "/api/users" is one possible endpoint to obtain a user list, for instance.
Sending calls to these endpoints and confirming that the results are what you expected are the steps involved in API testing. This guarantees that the API operates accurately and responds suitably to various conditions. Testing might involve making sure that data is submitted correctly, retrieved correctly, and updated or deleted accurately.

Reflection
My professional aspirations have been greatly aided by this course, which has given me the information and abilities I need to pursue a career in software development. I have gained knowledge and expertise in full stack web development, encompassing backend and frontend technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB in addition to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I've also grasped the ideas behind developing RESTful APIs, putting permission and authentication systems in place, and launching web apps into live settings. These abilities have improved my programming abilities but have also increased my marketability as a candidate in the cutthroat world of software development.
